As an Admin, you have the responsibility to set appropriate Priority Levels and SLAs according to the severity of the tickets. A critical issue like an entire online system not working could cause serious harm to the company, hence, it has to be a high priority (SEV-A). An inquiry for hardware refresh is in comparison, not a business-impacting issue, hence, SLA should be a "SEV-B".

<p>
An Admin also has the responsibility to Assign tickets to the appropriate departments and teams for accurate solutions to be given. Online Banking System is the responsibility of System Administrators, therefore, the ticket must be transferred to that department. Also, assign the General Inquiry ticket to Joe Doe in the Support department.

After transferring tickets to specific departments and teams, give a response to keep the necessary stakeholders of the issue aware of  what is happening.

Notice the ticket appeared on her dashboard after it was transferred to her department. After the online banking system is restored, a response must be posted.
